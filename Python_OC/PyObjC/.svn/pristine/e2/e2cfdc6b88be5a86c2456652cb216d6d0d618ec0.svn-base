\f0\fs24 \cf2 This example demonstrates calling into Python from Objective-C by using an abstract class defined in Objective-C that is then subclassed in Python.  Doing this has two advantages:\
\
\'95 The Objective-C code sees the type declarations in the abstract class.\
\
\'95 The Python subclass of the abstract class uses the method implementations to correctly figure out the type signatures.\
