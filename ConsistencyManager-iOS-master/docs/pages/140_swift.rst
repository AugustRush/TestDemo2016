Swift
=====

We chose to write this library in Swift instead of Objective-C for a few reasons:

	1. We wanted to support as many model types as possible including structs. The library will work with structs, classes, enums, and Objective-C classes.
	2. Immutability seems to have gained much more popularity since the release of Swift. I expect most people would use this library in Swift applications.
